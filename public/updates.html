                        Thanks for the overwhelming support from everyone. Here is a short update on procurement and Shipping efforts so far. Please feel free to share with anyone who has contributed to SUMO.
                        <ol class="text-justify">
                            <li>
                                Of the two experiment shipments sent, one has arrived well and safe in Delhi – cleared customs after much back n forth – calls and help from all around. Shipment took 5 days door-to-door after we managed to expedite customs clearance in China and India. Yuwell concentrators received are already being used in Delhi and the feedback from users is positive.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                No customs duty charged. However GST is charged at 12% plus 2-3% processing fee(s). The bulk order will be charged the same rate. 0% GST is only applicable for NGO’s/ other organizations that have been designated for covid relief work by state or national government. Both CEL and Mercy Mission are trying to get this status to minimize the GST spend
                            </li>

                                The team has reached out to over 40 different suppliers across the world. We shortlisted brands that are well regarded and actively being used for ongoing covid relief endeavors. Based on technical specs, feedback about on-ground situation, informal inputs from doctors, availability of supply (which literally changes by the minute) and timelines for delivery into India, we have placed deposits for the following. We have leveraged multiple sources to hedge our bets on lead times:

                            As tier 3/4/5 cities are registering a sharp spike in cases (and fatalities), we have  expanded the coverage of SUMO to more parts of India by partnering with NGO’s active in areas that are most effected. We are running an exhaustive KYC process with said NGO’s (including document checks) to ensure that these concentrators will be deployed efficiently. The NGO’s are also required to sign a letter of undertaking confirming they will deploy at no cost and provide us visibility on the re-use of the concentrators. So far, the following NGO’s have cleared our KYC process. Please find information on them at https://milaap.org/sumo
