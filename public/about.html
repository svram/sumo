            <h3>Samarpan</h3>
            <p class="text-justify"><a href="https://samarpankmc.com/">Samarpan</a> Society for Health, Research and Development was put together by a group of enthusiastic developmental professionals in 2001. Samarpan operates six urban primary health care centers in Dehradun, Uttar Pradesh and one in Ganganagar, Rajasthan.

They are actively engaged in COVID-19 care, tracking, monitoring, vaccination and treatment.</p>
            <h3>SEEDS</h3>
            <p class="text-justify"><a href="https://www.seedsindia.org/our-story/">SEEDS</a> was founded in 1994 and has one ultimate goal: building the resilience of people exposed to disasters. For the last 26 years, we have been enabling this through practical solutions for disaster readiness, response and rehabilitation.
